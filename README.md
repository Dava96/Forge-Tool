This script assumes you use the default keybinds in Eldewrito and you are using keyboard for inputs.

# What it does

Forge-Tool is a small gui application that aims to help the user have an easier time with the Forge gametype in 0.5.1.
Due to the hacky nature of the Eldewrito's 0.5.1 update.
It was difficult to use the Keyboard/Mouse to navigate the menus. This aimed to negate this by adding shortcuts that would automate certain processes. Such as saving the game or restarting the round.
This also shows how many objects you are able to place on all available maps before this it was previously unknown how many objects you could place on the map.


# Controls

In order for these to work you need to select your games resolution from the drop down list.

`Ctrl + S` - This saves the map automatically.

`Ctrl + R` - This restarts the round automatically.

`Ctrl + F` - This starts the auto delete function.

`Ctrl + G` - To stop the auto delete.

`Ctrl + B` - To rebind the keys in order for the Auto delete function to work. This is to prevent accidentally starting it.

`CapsLock` - Enables/Disables the tool from making inputs.
